# 🔥 Turning a real classroom challenge into an AI-powered solution.

# 📸 ClassLens

ClassLens is a multi-platform attendance automation system built to replace manual roll calls with an AI-powered mechanism using just one group photograph.  
By combining Computer Vision, Face Recognition, Vector Similarity Search, and a seamless UI across mobile and web, ClassLens enables faster, error-free, and more transparent attendance workflows.

## 🧠 Problem We Address  
Traditional attendance marking is:

❌ Time-consuming  
❌ Error-prone  
❌ Inefficient for large classrooms  

ClassLens eliminates this friction by automatically detecting student faces from a classroom image, matching them with stored embeddings, and producing verified attendance in seconds.
